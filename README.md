# Lab-8
Computer Architecture Lab Assignment

For this lab, I created a single cycle CPU datapath for a processor which uses RISC-V ISA. It is created ready to connect to a companion control unit.

The datapath in a processor consists of the program counter, instruction decoder, arithmetic logic unit, RAM, and accompanying hardware. Itâ€™s what fetches instructions, decodes them, reads and processes data from the register file and RAM, and writes them back for later use or as an output.
